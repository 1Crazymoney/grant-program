- An overview of the technology stack to be used

MemeFlate is a multi layered project and pulls from many open source libabries to build its tokens utilities and Dapps,
react/react.js is used to tie together our solidity smartcontracts along with Chainlink Vrf v2 and keepers protocol integrated in to Gaming and NFT-staking, NFTs have also been integrated with XP.network cross chain bridge techonolgy, allowing users to tranfer the projects NFT collection to and from multiple chains/networks inlcuding VeChain.

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

Most of the projects arhitetcure is already established and uses protocols provided by solidity. Any relevent documentaion can be sourced from memeflate.io .



### Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

There are simlier crypto based project to MemeFlates freelance  marketplace usecase but they are few and far bewteen, the more traditioal platforms that provide some the same services are all world leading and thus seen as an aspiration for the project.

MemeFlate strives to be different in many ways ranging from but not limited to the following:

Facebook type community centre allowing users to build profiles, add friends, send gifs, videos, photos and post updates, this allows buyers,sellers and users to interact with each other whilst building a level of trust and community among the site, visters and users.

MemeFlate focuses on user intraction to attract not only freelancers and cryptocurreny enthusiast but the everyday person too, MemeFlate acheivies this by offering a wide range of easy to use and relateable web3 Dapps to acommpany the maketplace usecase. MemeFlate will become the platform of choice in its secture with Freelance and how they receive cryptocurrency payments(stable coin),  Auto staking, optional staking, NFTs, NFT-Staking, Rewards, Game-Fi and social-Fi all on 1 platform.

As cryto is community driven MemeFlate is inclusive of those who wish to take part in the project and find ways to help people earn, so it has a merchaindise store open to community and marketplace users to design and earn (d2e) by providing designs for merch and earning from the procceeds.

MemeFlate was created by a creative mind and small busniess owner so this can be looked at as a cutting edge and willingness to see the project succeed.

MemeFlate would like to be innovative by also offering local services in which where a seller of perticaler goods in different parts of the world can ship items wished to be purchased in another part of the world and with MemeFlate having its inception in the crypto space it makes its range and prediction for growth exponential.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. | 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests |, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

## Future Plans

Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

MemeFlate and its ecosystem would like to provide freelancers away to earn a little bit extra and a stable way of receiving cryptocurrncies, by eliement the need for the platform to charge any commission unlike its competitors and create the first 'Freelancer Stable Coin' back by multi currencies maintaining its face value (USD ect) the marketplace will stand out amongest the Freelance sector.
 MemeFlate aims to make this stable innovative by creating a swap feature that allows a buyer/user of the platform to trade in any crypto currency in return for the coin, this coin is then used to pay freelancers who can then decide to trade it in for many crypto/fiat currenccies or stake the coin to receive competitive APR%,
(passive income), gifts and access stable coin related future products. With the expansion of the marketplace it would hope to secure substanuale partnerships with reputable orginastion to back the plaform giving freelance more ways to save/earn/ and use their stable coins.
